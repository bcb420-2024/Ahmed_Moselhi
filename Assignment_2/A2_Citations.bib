	abstract = {Radial glia, the neural stem cells of the neocortex, are located in two niches: the ventricular zone and outer subventricular zone. Although outer subventricular zone radial glia may generate the majority of human cortical neurons, their molecular features remain elusive. By analyzing gene expression across single cells, we find that outer radial glia preferentially express genes related to extracellular matrix formation, migration, and stemness, including TNC, PTPRZ1, FAM107A, HOPX, and LIFR. Using dynamic imaging, immunostaining, and clonal analysis, we relate these molecular features to distinctive behaviors of outer radial glia, demonstrate the necessity of STAT3 signaling for their cell cycle progression, and establish their extensive proliferative potential. These results suggest that outer radial glia directly support the subventricular niche through local production of growth factors, potentiation of growth factor signals by extracellular matrix proteins, and activation of self-renewal pathways, thereby enabling the developmental and evolutionary expansion of the human neocortex.,},

	abstract = {Cerebral organoids exhibit broad regional heterogeneity accompanied by limited cortical cellular diversity despite the tremendous upsurge in derivation methods, suggesting inadequate patterning of early neural stem cells (NSCs). Here we show that a short and early Dual SMAD and WNT inhibition course is necessary and sufficient to establish robust and lasting cortical organoid NSC identity, efficiently suppressing non-cortical NSC fates, while other widely used methods are inconsistent in their cortical NSC-specification capacity. Accordingly, this method selectively enriches for outer radial glia NSCs, which cyto-architecturally demarcate well-defined outer sub-ventricular-like regions propagating from superiorly radially organized, apical cortical rosette NSCs. Finally, this method culminates in the emergence of molecularly distinct deep and upper cortical layer neurons, and reliably uncovers cortex-specific microcephaly defects. Thus, a short SMAD and WNT inhibition is critical for establishing a rich cortical cell repertoire that enables mirroring of fundamental molecular and cyto-architectural features of cortical development and meaningful disease modelling., Rosebrock, Arora et al. report a method to overcome limited cortical cellular diversity in human organoids, thus mirroring fundamental features of cortical development and offering a basis for organoid-based disease modelling.},

One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

	abstract = {The screening of many endpoints when comparing groups from different strains, searching for some statistically significant difference, raises the multiple comparisons problem in its most severe form. Using the 0.05 level to decide which of the many endpoints' differences are statistically significant, the probability of finding a difference to be significant even though it is not real increases far beyond 0.05. The traditional approach to this problem has been to control the probability of making even one such error--the Bonferroni procedure being the most familiar procedure achieving such control. However, the incurred loss of power stemming from such control led many practitioners to neglect multiplicity control altogether. The False Discovery Rate (FDR), suggested by Benjamini and Hochberg [J Royal Stat Soc Ser B 57 (1995) 289], is a new, different, and compromising point of view regarding the error in multiple comparisons. The FDR is the expected proportion of false discoveries among the discoveries, and controlling the FDR goes a long way towards controlling the increased error from multiplicity while losing less in the ability to discover real differences. In this paper we demonstrate the problem in two studies: the study of exploratory behavior [Behav Brain Res (2001)], and the study of the interaction of strain differences with laboratory environment [Science 284 (1999) 1670]. We explain the FDR criterion, and present two simple procedures that control the FDR. We demonstrate their increased power when used in the above two studies.},

	abstract = {ZNF521 is a transcription co-factor with recognized regulatory functions in haematopoietic, osteo-adipogenic and neural progenitor cells. Among its diverse activities, ZNF521 has been implicated in the regulation of medulloblastoma (MB) cells, where the Hedgehog (HH) pathway, has a key role in the development of normal cerebellum and of a substantial fraction of MBs. Here a functional cross-talk is shown for ZNF521 with the HH pathway, where it interacts with GLI1 and GLI2, the major HH transcriptional effectors and enhances the activity of HH signalling. In particular, ZNF521 cooperates with GLI1 and GLI2 in the transcriptional activation of GLI (glioma-associated transcription factor)-responsive promoters. This synergism is dependent on the presence of the N-terminal, NuRD-binding motif in ZNF521, and is sensitive to HDAC (histone deacetylase) and GLI inhibitors. Taken together, these results highlight the role of ZNF521, and its interaction with the NuRD complex, in determining the HH response at the level of transcription. This may be of particular relevance in HH-driven diseases, especially regarding the MBs belonging to the SHH (sonic HH) subgroup where a high expression of ZNF521 is correlated with that of HH pathway components.},

	issn = {1757-6512},
	doi = {10.1186/s13287-019-1520-6},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Methods based on site-specific recombinases are widely used in studying gene activities in vivo and in vitro. In these studies, constitutively active or inducible variants of these recombinases are expressed under the control of either lineage-specific or ubiquitous promoters. However, there is a need for more advanced schemes that combine these features with possibilities to choose a time point from which lineage tracing starts in an autonomous fashion. For example, the key mammalian germline gatekeeper gene Oct4 (Pou5f1) is expressed in the peri-implantation epiblast which gives rise to all cells within embryos. Thus the above techniques are hardly applicable to Oct4 tracing past the epiblast stage, and the establishment of genetic tools addressing such a limitation is a highly relevant pursuit.
METHODS: The CRISPR/Cas9 tool was used to manipulate the genome of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and various cell culture technics-to maintain and differentiate ESCs to neural cell, lentivirus-based reprogramming technique-to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
RESULTS: In this paper, we have developed a two-component genetic system (referred to as O4S) that allows tracing Oct4 gene activity past the epiblast stage of development. The first component represents a knock-in of an ubiquitous promoter-driven inducible Cre, serving as a stop signal for downstream tdTomato. Upon activation of Cre activity with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) at any given time point, the recombinase excises a stop signal and poses the second component of the system-the FlpO recombinase, knocked into 3'UTR of Oct4, to be expressed upon activation of the latter gene. Oct4-driven expression of FlpO, in turn, triggers the tdTomato expression and thus, permanently marks Oct4+ cells and their progeny. We have validated the O4S system in cultured ESCs and shown that it is capable, for example, to timely capture an activation of Oct4 gene during the reprogramming of somatic cells into iPSCs.
CONCLUSIONS: The developed O4S system can be used to detect Oct4 activation event, both permanent and transient, in somatic cell types outside the germline. The approach can be equally adjusted to other genes, provided the first component of the system is placed under transcriptional control of these genes, thus, making it a valuable tool for cell fate mapping in mice.},

We first isolate early neuroepithelial cells and show their broad Notch-dependent developmental and proliferative potential. Neuroepithelial cells further yield successive Notch-dependent functional primary progenitors, from early and midneurogenic radial glia and their derived basal progenitors, to gliogenic radial glia and adult-like neural progenitors, together recapitulating hallmarks of neural stem cell (NSC) ontogeny. Gene expression profiling reveals dynamic stage-specific transcriptional patterns that may link development of distinct progenitor identities through Notch activation.

	abstract = {Wnt proteins are best known for their profound roles in cell patterning, because they are required for the embryonic development of all animal species studied to date. Besides regulating cell fate, Wnt proteins are gaining increasing recognition for their roles in nervous system development and function. New studies indicate that multiple positive and negative Wnt signaling pathways take place simultaneously during the formation of vertebrate and invertebrate neuromuscular junctions. Although some Wnts are essential for the formation of NMJs, others appear to play a more modulatory role as part of multiple signaling pathways. Here we review the most recent findings regarding the function of Wnts at the NMJ from both vertebrate and invertebrate model systems., Wnt signaling has emerged as an essential regulator of synaptic development and function. Multiple Wnt signaling pathways occur simultaneously during the formation of vertebrate and invertebrate neuromuscular junctions.},
